# Modern ESB Architecture with Quarkus

## Overview

An **Enterprise Service Bus (ESB)** acts as a middleware architecture pattern that integrates diverse applications and services through message routing, data transformation, and protocol conversion capabilities.

A **Servlet** functions as a server-side Java component handling HTTP requests and responses, providing backend logic for web services.

## Quarkus Integration

**Quarkus** brings modern Java development to containerized environments like Kubernetes. Its optimization for performance, rapid startup times, and minimal memory footprint makes it particularly suitable for microservices and cloud-native ESB implementations.

## Key Features

### Quarkus Advantages

* **Supersonic Startup Time**: Enables efficient serverless ESB deployments and dynamic scaling
* **Minimal Memory Footprint**: Optimizes container resource utilization and scaling capabilities
* **Developer Experience**: Accelerates development through live coding and rapid iteration

### Core ESB Functionality

* **Integration Hub**: Centralizes service and system connections
* **Servlet-Based Endpoints**: Manages HTTP communication with external systems
* **Message Transformation**: Handles format conversion between different services
* **Protocol Translation**: Enables communication between diverse protocols (REST, SOAP, etc.)
* **Service Orchestration**: Coordinates service workflows and operations

### Essential Quarkus Extensions

* **RESTEasy**: Powers RESTful service development
* **Kafka/ActiveMQ**: Enables asynchronous messaging
* **Camel Quarkus**: Implements enterprise integration patterns
* **Hibernate ORM/Panache**: Manages database operations
* **SmallRye**: Supports reactive programming and GraphQL APIs

## Development Benefits

* **Native Compilation**: GraalVM integration enables high-performance native executables
* **Event-Driven Architecture**: Built-in support through Camel and reactive programming
* **Comprehensive Observability**: Integrated monitoring and tracing via Micrometer and OpenTelemetry

## Common Use Cases

* **API Gateway**: Intelligent routing and traffic management between microservices
* **Data Transformation**: Seamless conversion between different data formats
* **Protocol Mediation**: Bridge between legacy and modern application protocols
* **Workflow Automation**: Orchestration of complex business processes

## Implementation Guide

### Required Dependencies

* Quarkus core dependencies
* RESTEasy for REST endpoints
* Camel Quarkus for integration
* Messaging support (Kafka/ActiveMQ)

### Project Structure

* Define integration routes using `camel-quarkus`
* Implement servlet endpoints for direct HTTP communication

### Configuration Management

* Centralize service URLs, database connections, and queue settings
* Leverage Quarkus's configuration system for environment management

## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:
```shell script
./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Quarkus now ships with a Dev UI, which is available in dev mode only at http://localhost:8080/q/dev/.

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:
```shell script
./mvnw package
```
It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `target/quarkus-app/` directory.
Be aware that it’s not an _über-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `target/quarkus-app/lib/` directory.

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.

If you want to build an _über-jar_, execute the following command:
```shell script
./mvnw package -Dquarkus.package.type=uber-jar
```

The application, packaged as an _über-jar_, is now runnable using `java -jar target/*-runner.jar`.

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using: 
```shell script
./mvnw package -Pnative
```

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using: 
```shell script
./mvnw package -Pnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
```

You can then execute your native executable with: `./target/esb-servlet-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`
